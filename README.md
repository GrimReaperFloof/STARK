STARK is an application that allows you to read commands from Source games and playback audio files, or use Text-to-Speech.
This is a project that evolved from a proof-of-concept [axynos](https://github.com/axynos) made a while ago using AutoHotKey [link](https://github.com/axynos/CSGO-Text-To-Speech).
